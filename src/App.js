                  <p/>We may have fought, cry, and blaming each other
                  <p/>But that's the part of relationship
                  <p/>It's part of growing together
                  <p/>So i wish even after all that obstacle,
                  <p/>Your love for me will not decrease
                  <p/>Not even a little bit

                  <p/>Maybe the world thinks it's too early
                  <p/>Too early for me to wish eternity with you
                  <p/>But the moments we've spent together

                  <p/>We'll smile, laugh, and cry happy tears
                  <p/>And I wish, when that time comes,
